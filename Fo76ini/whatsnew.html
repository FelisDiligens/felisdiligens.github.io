v1.12.0? - The dark mode update</h3>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>this update adds two themes to the tool: light and dark.<br />
By default, it uses your system settings, but you can also manually
select which theme you want to use.<br />
The dark mode isn't perfect and there were some elements I couldn't or
didn't change.</p>
<p>I hope your eyes are now soothed with the dark mode. :)</p>

after restarting the tool.</li>

<li>"What's new" is now accessible through a button click.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Info tab in Tweaks doesn't display the embedded webbrowser
anymore. Instead, there will be a button to open the info document in
the user's preferred browser.<br />

Windows versions. Windows 10 and 11 aren't affected)</li>
